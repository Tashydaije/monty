# Monty ByteCodes Interpreter

# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Learning Objectives

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues,
* What is the proper way to use global variables

## Description

This project is about creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files so as to achieve the above learning objectives.

## Compilation & Output

* The code will be compiled this way:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
* Any output must be printed on stdout
